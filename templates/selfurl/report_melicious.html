            Reporting malicious URLs is crucial for maintaining a secure online environment for all users. 
            Cybersecurity threats, such as phishing attempts, malware distribution, and scams, are pervasive in the digital landscape. 
            By allowing users to report suspicious and harmful URLs, we empower our community to actively contribute to the safety and protection of one another.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify mt-0 mb-2 text-muted">
            When users report URLs they find concerning, we prioritize their concerns and take immediate action to ensure the safety of our community. Upon receiving 
            a report of a potentially malicious URL, we promptly block or disable access to the identified content both through our service and all associated logs generated by the URL.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify mt-0 mb-2 text-muted">
            However, we understand that in rare instances, a reported URL may be flagged in error. To address this, our service employs scheduled automated vigilance. 
            If our automated systems find that a URL has been mistakenly reported, we promptly unblock it, restoring access to the original content.
        </p>
